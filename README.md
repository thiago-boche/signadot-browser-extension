# Signadot Browser Extension

The Signadot Browser Extension simplifies testing web applications in sandbox environments by automatically injecting routing headers into browser requests.

# üöÄ Features
- Sandbox & Route Group Selection: Authenticate to view and select from a dropdown of available sandboxes and route groups.
- One-Click Toggle: Easily enable or disable routing to sandbox environments without altering code.
- Automatic Header Injection: Injects necessary headers like baggage and tracestate (as well as custom routing headers configured) to route traffic appropriately.

## Browser Differences

### Chrome Version
- Uses Manifest V3
- Uses `declarativeNetRequest` API for efficient header injection
- Service worker background script
- Built to `dist-chrome/` directory

### Firefox Version  
- Uses Manifest V2
- Uses `webRequest` API with blocking requests for header injection
- Traditional background script (not service worker)
- Built to `dist-firefox/` directory
- Requires additional permissions: `webRequest`, `webRequestBlocking`

Both versions provide identical functionality but use browser-appropriate APIs for maximum compatibility and performance.
